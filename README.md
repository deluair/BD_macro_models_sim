# Bangladesh Macroeconomic Models Simulation Project

ðŸŽ‰ **Status: All 15 Models Successfully Implemented and Operational** ðŸŽ‰

This project implements a comprehensive suite of 15 major macroeconomic models for Bangladesh using real economic data from various sources including Bangladesh Bank, World Bank, IMF, and other official statistics. All models have been successfully tested and are generating reliable simulation results.

## Overview

Bangladesh has experienced robust economic growth averaging 6% annually over the past two decades, transitioning from one of the poorest nations to lower-middle income status in 2015. This project provides comprehensive macroeconomic modeling tools to analyze Bangladesh's economy using various modeling approaches.

### 7. New Keynesian Model with Heterogeneous Agents (HANK)
- **Purpose**: Inequality and aggregate demand, distributional effects of policy
- **Features**: Heterogeneous households, incomplete markets, idiosyncratic risk
- **Applications**: Fiscal multipliers, monetary policy distribution effects, inequality dynamics

### 8. Game Theoretic Models
- **Purpose**: Strategic interactions, policy coordination, institutional analysis
- **Features**: Nash equilibrium, cooperative/non-cooperative games, mechanism design
- **Applications**: Central bank independence, fiscal federalism, international coordination

### 9. Real Business Cycle (RBC) Model
- **Purpose**: Technology-driven fluctuations, productivity analysis
- **Features**: Perfect competition, flexible prices, technology shocks
- **Applications**: Growth accounting, productivity trends, structural transformation

### 10. New Economic Geography (NEG) Model
- **Purpose**: Spatial economics, regional development, agglomeration effects
- **Features**: Transport costs, increasing returns, core-periphery patterns
- **Applications**: Regional inequality, industrial clusters, infrastructure investment

### 11. Search and Matching Model
- **Purpose**: Labor market dynamics, unemployment analysis
- **Features**: Job search frictions, matching functions, wage bargaining
- **Applications**: Employment policies, labor market reforms, skills mismatch

### 12. Behavioral Macroeconomic Model
- **Purpose**: Psychological factors in economic decisions
- **Features**: Bounded rationality, behavioral biases, adaptive learning
- **Applications**: Financial bubbles, policy communication, expectation management

### 13. Agent-Based Model (ABM)
- **Purpose**: Complex adaptive systems, emergent phenomena
- **Features**: Heterogeneous agents, local interactions, non-linear dynamics
- **Applications**: Financial contagion, network effects, systemic risk

### 14. Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)
- **Purpose**: Climate-economy interactions, environmental policy
- **Features**: Climate damages, carbon pricing, green transition
- **Applications**: Carbon tax policy, climate adaptation, sustainable development

### 15. Small Open Economy Model
- **Purpose**: External sector analysis, exchange rate dynamics
- **Features**: Foreign sector interactions, capital flows, terms of trade
- **Applications**: Exchange rate policy, capital account liberalization, external shocks

## Key Economic Features of Bangladesh
