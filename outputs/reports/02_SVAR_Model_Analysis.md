### Model Configuration
- **Identification Method**: Cholesky decomposition
- **Lag Order**: 2 periods
- **Sample Size**: 55 observations
- **Estimation Period**: Based on available Bangladesh macroeconomic data

## Model Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Log-likelihood | 1,097.61 | Model fit measure |
| AIC | -53.12 | Akaike Information Criterion |

## Policy Implications

### Monetary Policy Transmission
The model successfully analyzes monetary transmission mechanisms through:
- Dynamic identification of policy variables (inflation used as proxy)
- Impulse response tracking of policy shocks
- Quantification of transmission lags and magnitudes

### Economic Shock Analysis
- **External Shocks**: Current account and exports growth responses
- **Domestic Shocks**: GDP growth and unemployment interactions
- **Price Dynamics**: Inflation transmission to real variables

### Forecasting Applications
- Short to medium-term economic projections
- Policy scenario analysis
- Risk assessment and uncertainty quantification
